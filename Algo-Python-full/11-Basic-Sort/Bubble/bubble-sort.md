Accept a parameter my_list that represents the list of integers to be sorted.

Iterate through the list from the last element to the first element. For each element i, perform the following steps:

Iterate through the list from the first element to the element at position i - 1. For each element j, perform the following steps:

Compare the element at position j with the element at position j + 1. If the element at position j is greater than the element at position j + 1, swap the two elements.

Return the sorted list.
